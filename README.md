# ds_list
Shared library for common linear, non-primitive data structures

## Features
* All classes are designed to be stl-compatible. This means C++ standard library algorithms can be applied to them.
* Typical operations can now be user-defined and can take advantage of class-specific iterators and stl algorithms, making wrapper classes for the visualizer easier to write. 


## Supported containers
### List-Types
* Array-based, random-access: `list` (fixed-size), 
* Link-based, sequential access: `slinked_list`, `dlinked_list`

Note that a majority of the `deque` types are simple adapter classes and can be developed by deriving and hiding a fragment of the interfaces defined by the `list` types. What this means is that they simply “wrap” one of the four public containers in the shared library. In particular, `linked_queue` and `linked_stack` implement a common `deque` interface and define `push`, `pop`, and `peek` by means of the methods contained in `dlinked_list`. In a similar vein, `array_queue` and `array_stack` take after `array_list`. 

The adapters `queue` and `stack` are similar in functionality to `array_queue` and `array_stack`, except `queue` and `stack` are not inherently resizable (static capacity).

### Deque Types
* `linked_queue`, `queue`, `array_queue`
* `linked_stack`, `stack`, `array_stack`
* `array_deque`

## TODO
* Append `dsl` namespace (namespace refactor)
* An extension to the dsl namespace defining the adapters discussed above
* Build instructions
* Unit testing
